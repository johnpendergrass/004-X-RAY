02-06-2015 -- 02-07-2015.  X-RAY - using html and css -hover- and -opacity- features to reveal hidden areas in a picture.

I wanted to experiment with more css features - figured that -hover- and transitions/transforms would be a good place to start.  Figured that it would be more fun to use game elements, so used dungeon crawl ideas to show what a user might get if she had 'x-ray' googles.

Still boring, and static, and worst of all... uses -absolute- positioning exclusively.  Gotta figure out how to latch onto another element to allow relative positioning to it.
